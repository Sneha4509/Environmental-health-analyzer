Problem statement:Design an AI system that can collect, process, and analyze various types of environmental data, including air quality, water pollution, deforestation rates, and climate patterns. The system should provide real-time insights and visualizations to understand the current state of the environment. 
Solution: The AI system will gather data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, weather stations, and databases.These sources provide information about air quality, water pollution, deforestation rates, climate patterns, and other relevant environmental factors.The system will then clean the data and process it to make it into a unified format. The AI system will then employ machine learning algorithms and identify patterns, correlations, and trends to understand the current state of the environment
This is just a prototype of the actual idea, which uses a support vector classifier to tell whether the environment is in "Extremely GoodThis is just a prototype of the actual idea, which uses a support vector classifier to tell whether the environment is in "extremely good," "extremely bad," "moderately good," or "moderately bad" condition.
With a powerful AI system and a team of expert developers, the collection of datasets will become automated, and better visualization can be achieved.
The current model just considers 3 features: "Air Pollution Index" ," Water Pollution index" and "Deforestation loss" but other features can be added as the dataset and AI model scales.

# Steps to run the model:
Download and execute the file model.py in python 3.9.4 or higher version.
Use the latest version of libraries : sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.svm , sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.metrics, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot.
Use dataset.csv to train and test the model.

# Accuracy
The accuracy of the model is approximately 96 percent.
